# Routine Tracker

A Ruby on Rails application for tracking personal data and routines through customizable forms, with powerful analytics and visualization capabilities.

## Overview

Routine Tracker helps you collect, organize, and analyze personal data through structured surveys and forms. Whether you're tracking health metrics, daily habits, mood patterns, or any other routine data, this application provides the tools to capture information consistently and gain insights through metrics and dashboards.

> **Self-Hosted Only**: This is a personal data tracking application designed for self-hosting. I don't provide a hosted service and don't want your data - you run it yourself, you control your data completely.

## Core Concepts

### Data Collection Hierarchy

The application uses a hierarchical structure for organizing and collecting data:

```
Forms
â”œâ”€â”€ Sections
    â”œâ”€â”€ Questions
        â””â”€â”€ Answers (stored in Responses)
```

#### **Forms**
- Top-level containers that group related sections
- Represent complete surveys or data collection sessions
- Can be filled out multiple times to create different responses
- Support draft functionality for partial completion across sessions

#### **Sections** 
- Logical groupings of related questions within a form
- Help organize complex forms into manageable chunks
- Can be reused across multiple forms

#### **Questions**
- Individual data points you want to collect
- Can be answered within forms OR standalone for quick data entry
- Support multiple types:
  - **String**: Text input
  - **Number**: Numeric input
  - **Bool**: Yes/No checkbox
  - **Range**: Dropdown with predefined options (min/max values)
- **Flexible Usage**: Use forms for structured data collection, or answer questions directly when forms feel too heavyweight

#### **Responses & Answers**
- **Response**: A complete form submission session
- **Answer**: Individual question responses within a response
- Each answer stores the actual data value based on question type

### Analytics & Visualization

#### **Metrics**
Transform raw answer data into meaningful analytics:

- **Functions**:
  - `answer`: Direct values from question responses
  - `sum`: Add values from multiple metrics
  - `average`: Average values from multiple metrics  
  - `difference`: Subtract metrics from each other
  - `count`: Count non-zero values

- **Time Resolution**: 
  - `five_minute`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`

- **Time Width**:
  - `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `90_days`, `yearly`, `all_time`

- **Wrap Functionality**: Overlay data by time patterns
  - `none`: Standard timeline view
  - `hour`: Show patterns within an hour (0-59 minutes)
  - `day`: Show patterns within a day (00:00-23:59)  
  - `weekly`: Show patterns within a week

#### **Dashboards**
Customizable views that can display:
- Metrics with time-series visualizations
- Quick-access question answering
- Links to forms for easy data entry

#### **Alerts**
Automated notifications based on metric thresholds to help you stay on track with your routines.

### Organization

#### **Namespaces**
Hierarchical organization system (e.g., `health.fitness`, `home.chores`) that helps categorize and filter all entities for better organization.

#### **Users**
Multi-user support with data isolation - each user sees only their own forms, responses, and metrics.

## Key Features

### ðŸš€ **Flexible Data Entry**
- **Structured Forms**: Complete surveys with multiple sections and auto-save drafts
- **Quick Questions**: Answer individual questions directly when forms are overkill
- **Cross-device Sync**: Continue forms on any device where you're logged in
- **Flexible Question Types**: String, number, boolean, and range inputs
- **Reusable Components**: Share sections across multiple forms

### ðŸ“Š **Powerful Analytics** 
- **Time-series Visualization**: See trends and patterns over time
- **Flexible Aggregation**: Sum, average, count, and compare metrics
- **Pattern Recognition**: Wrap functionality reveals daily/weekly patterns
- **Multi-resolution Analysis**: From 5-minute intervals to monthly trends

### ðŸ“ˆ **Interactive Dashboards**
- **Custom Views**: Create personalized dashboards for different use cases
- **Mixed Content**: Combine metrics, quick questions, and form links
- **Real-time Updates**: See your latest data immediately

### ðŸ”” **Smart Alerts**
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Get notified when metrics cross important values
- **Routine Reminders**: Stay consistent with your tracking habits

## Example Use Cases

### Health & Fitness Tracking
```
Form: "Daily Health Check"
â”œâ”€â”€ Section: "Physical Metrics"
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Weight (number)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Sleep Hours (number)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Exercise (bool)
â””â”€â”€ Section: "Mental Wellness"
    â”œâ”€â”€ Mood (range: 1-10)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Stress Level (range: 1-5)
    â””â”€â”€ Meditation (bool)
```

**Metrics Examples:**
- Average daily weight with `wrap: "none"` to see weight trends
- Sleep patterns with `resolution: "day"`, `wrap: "weekly"` to see which days you sleep best
- Exercise consistency with `function: "count"` to track workout frequency

### Home Management
```
Form: "Household Tasks"
â”œâ”€â”€ Section: "Maintenance"
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Cleaned Kitchen (bool)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Watered Plants (bool)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Checked Mail (bool)
â””â”€â”€ Section: "Utilities"
    â”œâ”€â”€ Water Pressure (range: 1-10)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Temperature (number)
    â””â”€â”€ Energy Usage (number)
```

**Dashboard Setup:**
- Quick daily task checkboxes (answer questions directly)
- Water pressure trend metric
- Link to weekly deep-cleaning form

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

   - Drafts save automatically as you type
   - Submit when complete

3. **Create metrics**
   - Navigate to Metrics â†’ New Metric
   - Choose questions to analyze
   - Set time resolution and width
   - Experiment with wrap settings for pattern analysis

4. **Build a dashboard**
