# Routine Tracker

A Ruby on Rails application for tracking personal data and routines through customizable forms, with powerful analytics, automated reporting, and comprehensive backup capabilities.

## Overview

Routine Tracker helps you collect, organize, and analyze personal data through structured surveys and forms. Whether you're tracking health metrics, daily habits, mood patterns, or any other routine data, this application provides the tools to capture information consistently and gain insights through metrics, dashboards, alerts, and automated reports.

> **Self-Hosted Only**: This is a personal data tracking application designed for self-hosting. I don't provide a hosted service and don't want your data - you run it yourself, you control your data completely.

## Core Concepts

### Data Collection Hierarchy

The application uses a hierarchical structure for organizing and collecting data:

```
Forms
â”œâ”€â”€ Sections
    â”œâ”€â”€ Questions
        â””â”€â”€ Answers (stored in Responses OR standalone)
```

#### **Forms**
- Top-level containers that group related sections
- Represent complete surveys or data collection sessions
- Can be filled out multiple times to create different responses
- Support draft functionality for partial completion across sessions

#### **Sections** 
- Logical groupings of related questions within a form
- Help organize complex forms into manageable chunks
- Can be reused across multiple forms

#### **Questions**
- Individual data points you want to collect
- Can be answered within forms OR standalone for quick data entry
- Support multiple types:
  - **String**: Text input
  - **Number**: Numeric input
  - **Bool**: Yes/No checkbox
  - **Range**: Dropdown with predefined options (min/max values)
- **Flexible Usage**: Use forms for structured data collection, or answer questions directly when forms feel too heavyweight

#### **Responses & Answers**
- **Response**: A complete form submission session
- **Answer**: Individual question responses within a response OR standalone adhoc answers
- Each answer stores the actual data value based on question type
- **Adhoc Answers**: Questions can be answered directly without being part of a form response

### Analytics & Visualization

#### **Metrics**
Transform raw answer data into meaningful analytics:

- **Functions**:
  - `answer`: Direct values from question responses
  - `sum`: Add values from multiple metrics
  - `average`: Average values from multiple metrics  
  - `difference`: Subtract metrics from each other
  - `count`: Count non-zero values

- **Time Resolution**: 
  - `five_minute`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`

- **Time Width**:
  - `daily`, `7_days`, `weekly`, `30_days`, `monthly`, `90_days`, `yearly`, `all_time`

- **Fill Missing Data**: Handle gaps in your data
  - `none`: Only show actual data points
  - `zero`: Fill gaps with zero values
  - `previous`: Maintain the last known value
  - `linear`: Interpolate between known values

- **Wrap Functionality**: Overlay data by time patterns
  - `none`: Standard timeline view
  - `hour`: Show patterns within an hour (0-59 minutes)
  - `day`: Show patterns within a day (00:00-23:59)  
  - `weekly`: Show patterns within a week

#### **Dashboards**
Customizable views that can display:
- Metrics with time-series visualizations
- Quick-access question answering
- Links to forms for easy data entry
- Links to other dashboards for nested navigation
- Alerts for monitoring important thresholds

#### **Alerts**
Smart monitoring system that tracks your metrics:
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Get notified when metrics cross important values
- **Flexible Conditions**: Above/below thresholds with configurable delay
- **Multiple Data Points**: Require multiple consecutive readings before activation
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear status with color coding
- **Integration**: Can be included in dashboards and reports

#### **Reports**
Automated email reports to keep you informed:
- **Scheduled Delivery**: Daily, weekly, or monthly reports
- **Flexible Timing**: Choose specific times and days for delivery
- **Content Mixing**: Combine multiple metrics and alerts in one report
- **Manual Testing**: Send reports immediately to test configuration
- **Rich Formatting**: HTML emails with charts and current values

### Data Management

#### **Backup System**
Complete data protection with encrypted backups:
- **Automated Backups**: Daily encrypted backups sent to your email
- **Manual Testing**: Send backup immediately to verify configuration
- **Encryption**: All backups are encrypted with a unique key
- **Comprehensive Data**: Includes all forms, questions, responses, metrics, and settings
- **JSON Format**: Easy to parse and restore if needed

#### **Caching & Performance**
Optimized for responsive data analysis:
- **Metric Caching**: Expensive time-series calculations are cached
- **Smart Invalidation**: Caches are cleared when underlying data changes
- **Background Jobs**: Reports and backups run in background queues
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized database queries for large datasets

### Organization

#### **Namespaces**
Hierarchical organization system (e.g., `health.fitness`, `home.chores`) that helps categorize and filter all entities:
- **Hierarchical Access**: When in a namespace, access all sub-namespaces
- **Flexible Navigation**: Easy browsing through folder-like structure
- **Cross-Reference**: Create reports that pull from multiple related namespaces
- **Isolation**: Keep different areas of your life organized separately

#### **Users**
Multi-user support with complete data isolation - each user sees only their own forms, responses, and metrics.
